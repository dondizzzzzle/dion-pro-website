This repository will store citations and resources I collect during my research into literary history, particularly the evolution of surrealist-adjacent movements in France.

Three of my preliminary sources are:
- *The Penguin Book of Oulipo,* edited by Phillip Terry
- *Pataphysical Essays,* written by Rene Daumal and translated by Thomas Vosteen
- *Ubu Roi,* written by Alfred Jarry

The source list is not final.
